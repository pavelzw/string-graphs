\begin{lemma}
A string graph can be realized by a family of polygonal arcs with a finite number of intersections.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume string graph realized by \( (C_i)_{i\in I} \). Let \(C = \bigcup_{i\in I} C_i\).
\(C\) is compact since it is bounded and closed. Let \(p \in C\) and \(O \ni p\) an open neighborhood 
in the plane. \(O\) \textit{respects} the family of curves if \(O\) only intersects curves that contain \(p\).

Every point has at least one such neighborhood (curves are compact). 
Let \(\mathcal{O}\) be the colection of all open neighborhoods of \(p\in C\) that respect 
the family \((C_i)_{i\in I}\). 

\(\mathcal{O}\) is an open cover of \(C\). \(\Rightarrow\) it contains a finite subcover 
\(\mathcal{O}'\) of \(C\). \(\Rightarrow\) each curve \(C_i\) is contained 
in a finite collection \(\mathcal{O}_i' \subseteq \mathcal{O}'\) of open sets
none of whom contain any points of curves \(C_j\) that \(C_i\) does not intersect. 

Replace \(C_i\) with a simple polygonal arc \(P_i\) in \(\mathcal{O}_i'\) 
while guaranteeing that \(P_i\) intersects \(P_j\) if \(C_i\) and \(C_j\) intersect.
(Possible since \(\exists O \in \mathcal{O}'\) which contains a common intersection point of \(C_i\) and \(C_j\)).

\begin{lemma}
    Every word of length \(\geq 2^n\) over an alphabet of size \(n\) contains a non-trivial subword in which every character occurs an even number of times.

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(G\) be a graph with \(m\) edges, \(R \subseteq \binom{E}{2}\) such that \((G, R)\) is weakly realizable, and let \(D\) 
    be a weak realization of \((G, R)\) with the minimal number of intersections. Then for any edge \(e \in G\) 
    there are less than \(2^m\) intersections on the curve realizing \(e\) in \(D\).
